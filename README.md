# Ascites
Ascites modeling, following the paper from Levitt and Levitt (Levitt, David G., and Michael D. Levitt. 2012. “Quantitative Modeling of the Physiology of Ascites in Portal Hypertension.” BMC Gastroenterology 12 (March): 26.), coupled with hemodynamics.

One needs a recent Physiolibrary (https://github.com/filip-jezek/Physiolibrary/tree/v2.4_maintenance) to run the model.
